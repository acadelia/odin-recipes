        While many of us associate lasagna pasta with Italy, 
        there are others who would attest that lasagna originated in Greece or England. 
        However, most reports seem to indicate that this pasta dish - as we now know it - 
        made its first appearance in the Italian city of Naples during the Middle Ages
